### Business rules

- The transaction can be done as a credit that will add to the total amount, or debit will subtract;

## Development

To run the code in development mode, you need to have the following technologies installed:

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Fastify
- Knex
- Sqlite
- Zod

### Follow these steps:

- Clone the repository.
- Install the dependencies using npm install.
- Run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode using npm run dev.
- And the server will already be running
- Use some tool to make requests and visualize them like postman or insomnia
