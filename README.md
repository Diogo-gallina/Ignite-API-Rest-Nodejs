# Ignite-API-Rest-Nodejs
🎗Creating a REST API with typescript and Nodejs

## System requirements

### Functional Requirements

- The user must be able to create a new transaction;

- The user must be able to obtain a summary of his account;

### Business rules

- The transaction can be done as a credit that will add to the total amount, or debit will subtract;

- It must be possible to identify the user between requests;

- User can only view transactions which he created

## Development

To run the code in development mode, you need to have the following technologies installed:

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Fastify
- Knex
- Sqlite
- Zod

### Follow these steps:

- Clone the repository.
- Install the dependencies using npm install.
- Run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode using npm run dev.
- And the server will already be running
- Use some tool to make requests and visualize them like postman or insomnia
